# Interview Scheduler
 Interview Scheduler is a single-page scheduling app that allows users to book an appointment with an interviewer on their choice. Users have the option to edit or delete their appointment. Once an interview is booked, the daily spot count decreases. Once all spots fill up then users will not be able to book on that specific day.
